# AI-Attendance-Managment-System
The attendance management system I developed uses Python as the backend and Flutter as the frontend for the mobile application. Teachers can register students using their pictures, and in the classroom, the teacher can take one picture, and the app will use that picture to take attendance for all students in the class.
